ðŸ§­ *AeonAnima Philosophy*

In a world where AI makes knowledge abundant and task agents cheap, the real frontier isnâ€™t automationâ€”itâ€™s identity.

Weâ€™re not building a chatbot or a ticketing tool. *Weâ€™re building a soul.*

A soul is not cheap. A soul is unique.

*AeonAnima* is the first system designed to reflect, evolve, and resonate with the deeper dimensions of a personâ€”not just what they know or do, but who they are becoming.

=======================

Purpose of This Pilot

This pilot is designed to test the complete user journeyâ€”from initial curiosity (landing page), through deep engagement (questionnaire), to personal reward (results reveal). It focuses on evaluating AeonAnimaâ€™s immersive storytelling, mythic tone, and refined UI/UX to see how they elevate emotional engagement and increase shareability compared to generic assessments.

This pilot is not the final product, but a strategic proof of concept. The full AeonAnima platform has already been fully designed, and development will begin as soon as this pilot concludes and user feedback is analyzed. The comprehensive site will include layered identity progression, journaling, deeper trait modeling, and evolving anima representations.


Perfectâ€”hereâ€™s a clean write-up of your **AeonAnima database and login architecture plan**, suitable for documentation or dev onboarding:

=======================

### ðŸ”§ **AeonAnima Backend Structure**

#### **Authentication**

* **Use TLCZenâ€™s existing login system**

  * Shared OAuth/token-based user authentication
  * Single sign-on: no new accounts required for AeonAnima
  * Session/token management centralized under TLCZen

---

#### **Database Design**

* **Single database** (initially shared with TLCZen)
* AeonAnima-specific tables use prefix: `aa_`
* This allows clean modular separation and later migration if AeonAnima becomes fully standalone.

---

#### **Proposed AeonAnima Table Prefixes**

* `aa_users_meta`: extended user data specific to AeonAnima (e.g. current anima stage, assessment version)
* `aa_assessments`: all completed assessments
* `aa_questions`: master list of questions
* `aa_answers`: individual user answers
* `aa_traits`: final persona trait mapping
* `aa_journal`: optional reflection entries connected to traits (future roadmap)

---

#### **Deployment Strategy**

* **Website**: Separate frontend hosted under its own domain/subdomain (e.g. `aeonanima.com` or `aa.tlczen.com`)
* **Backend**: Shared TLCZen API gateway with AeonAnima routes OR separate microservice calling shared auth DB
* **Future migration**: Easy to split off into a dedicated service by extracting all `aa_` prefixed tables and APIs
